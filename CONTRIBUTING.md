1. **Replace Placeholders**: Ensure you replace placeholders like `yourusername`, `Your Name`, and links with your actual GitHub username, name, and relevant URLs.

2. **Logo Image**: Update the logo path in the `README.md` if you have a logo for BoltStatic. If not, you can remove or replace the image section.

3. **Badges**: The badges (License, npm version, Build Status) assume you have set up CI/CD workflows and published BoltStatic to npm. Update or remove these badges as appropriate.

5. **Plugin Development Guide**: The `README.md` references a `[Plugin Development Guide](docs/plugins.md)`. Ensure you create this file within your `docs/` directory to provide detailed instructions on developing plugins.
